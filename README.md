# commUNITY

CommUNITY is a mobile application designed to address the broken infrastructure in a community and help residents make it a safer place to thrive and live.

This application aims to address this issue by offering users to be part of the community that tracks and reports these issues. Residents will be able to register in their local region and report, confirm and keep track of issues around their community in real time.
